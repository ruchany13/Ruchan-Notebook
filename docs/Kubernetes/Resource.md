# Kubernetes Learning Resources
*As I explore and learn more about Kubernetes, I've gathered several resources that have been helpful along the way. To make these resources accessible and useful for others, I've organized them by topics such as networking, storage, and more. Each topic includes both written and video content, and I've documented them here in markdown format.*
