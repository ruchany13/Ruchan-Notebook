## 💡 Latest Projects

### High Availability Kubernetes Cluster Setup for Customers
This project involved designing and deploying a highly available Kubernetes cluster for customer applications. After setting up the base Kubernetes environment, a Harbor private registry was installed for image management. PostgreSQL was chosen as the application database, and Barman was configured for database disaster recovery and point-in-time recovery. Ansible Playbooks were developed to automate repetitive setup steps. For storage orchestration, Rook was deployed to manage Ceph distributed storage across the cluster. The system was monitored using Prometheus and Grafana, ensuring proactive issue detection and resource optimization.

- **Technologies**: Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, Grafana, Prometheus, Harbor, Ansible, Barman


### Distributed Smart City Application on Edge Devices
In this research project, a hybrid Cloud and Edge Computing solution was developed to monitor air quality across Yalova University campus. Raspberry Pi 4 devices equipped with temperature and humidity sensors collected environmental data. Applications ran in Docker containers on the edge devices, and K3S lightweight Kubernetes was deployed to manage workloads. Data collected from sensors were transmitted to a central server powered by Jetson Nano devices. A web interface was built to display the air quality metrics, and Ganglia was used to monitor energy consumption, network usage, and system performance, enabling a comparison between pure cloud and hybrid cloud-edge architectures.

### On-Premise Password Management System
A secure, self-hosted password management system was implemented using Passbolt, running inside Docker containers with an external PostgreSQL database. Backup strategies were established by configuring Rclone to automate daily uploads of database snapshots and configuration files to Google Drive, using scheduled cron jobs. User guides were prepared and end-user training sessions were conducted to ensure proper system adoption and security practices.

- **Technologies**: Docker, PostgreSQL, Rclone
